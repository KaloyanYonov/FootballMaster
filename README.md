This is a personal Project of mine, which is my way of learning and improving with React (with Vite).


The project is a quiz game where you test your football knowledge in three categories : Champions league winners, Ballon'dor winners and World cup winners (will probably add more as time goes by). The quiz has 2 levels of difficulty - Easy and Hard.

To learn more about the quiz, head over to the About page when you run it.

Have fun!
